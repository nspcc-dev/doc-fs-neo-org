The incentive model and pricing follow free-market principles. Each node declares how much it wants to receive as a reward for data storage services for the upcoming epoch. Placement function considers the declared price and prefers nodes with better prices. However, because nodes in Network Map declare key-value attributes describing their parameters, such as geographical location, type of storage, capacity and others also used in Storage Policy, it leaves an opportunity for nodes that want a higher price and have better or unique services to still get into the placement function result.
