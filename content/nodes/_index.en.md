NeoFS network nodes run the same software and talk the same protocol but may have different roles. There are nodes that store data and process user API requests, they are regular storage nodes and form the Outer Ring.

There are nodes that take care of network health, perform service tasks such as data audit and payments settlements and form the Inner Ring. There are not many of them and they use dBFT 2.0 consensus algorithm to coordinate their actions.
